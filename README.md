# Fitness-Application

CS2001 Group project - Group 40

The thoughts behind this idea were to help and provide users with a simple web app design, that makes it easy for users to monitor their health and well-being. Our finteness web application aims to help university students engage more actively in physical activities, such as running, as the percentage of physically active students has sky rocketed down in the UK, and also around the world.

As a group we believe that the environment around us has a strong correlation with personal health/well-being. Meaning, the more toxic the envirenment is, the more negative effect it will have on your health/mentality. Thus we support non-profit organisations, such as:
